# Cows & Bulls

Welcome to Cows and Bulls!

The user needs to guess a random, 4 digit number from 1000 to 9999.  Cows indicate that the user provided an existing digit in its correct position while a bull indicates the user provided an existing digit in the wrong position.  No cows or bulls indicate that the user provided a number with digits that do not exist within the randomly generated number.  The user isn't provided which digits entered are cows and/or bulls and must keep guessing until the user wins.  The user wins when the random number has been guessed.  The number of attempts at guessing is provided upon winning.  Try with your friends and see who can guess the least!
